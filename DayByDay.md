Friday Afternoon & Weekend:

Research and familiarize myself with the Web Audio API and how to generate and manipulate audio in real-time. Identify and collect drum samples to use in your project. Start building the basic layout and user interface of your application using HTML and CSS.

Monday:

Set up the basic functionality of the sequencer using the Web Audio API and JavaScript. Implement the ability to play and pause the beat using a button. Start building the controls for adjusting the volume and tempo of the beat.

Tuesday:

Continue building the controls for adjusting the volume and tempo of the beat. Implement the ability to save the beat directly to the user's computer using the FileSaver.js library. Begin building the sharing functionality for the beat, allowing users to share their created beats via social media or URL.

Wednesday:

Implement the sharing functionality, allowing users to share their created beats via social media or URL. Finish building the user interface and controls, ensuring that the application is visually appealing and easy to use. Test the application thoroughly, ensuring that all features are working properly and that there are no bugs or errors.

Thursday Morning:

Finalize any remaining tasks or fixes based on testing. Write clear and concise instructions for using the application and include them in a README file. Submit my completed project, share it with the cohort. Celebrate!
