Hello! The project is a web application that allows users to create their own beats using a sequencer. The sequencer has five different sound components, including a kick, hi-hat, snare, 808, and an oscillator. Users can adjust the volume, tempo, and other parameters to customize their beats. The application also has a pause/play button and the ability to save and share beats with others. The goal of the project is to provide a fun and engaging tool for music enthusiasts to create and share their own beats online.

In "FableTon", users will be able to:

Create custom beats using a sequencer that consists of a kick, hi-hat, snare, 808, and an oscillator. Adjust the volume, tempo, and other parameters to customize the beats to their liking. Save their created beats directly to their computer. Share their created beats with others via social media or direct URL.

In addition, this project will include:

Clear and concise instructions on how to use the application in the README file. An easy-to-navigate interface that is user-friendly and visually appealing. Real-time audio processing and playback for smooth and seamless beat creation. A responsive design that is optimized for desktop devices.

FableTon will use several technologies, libraries, and APIs to provide a rich user experience:

Web Audio API: This API will be used for real-time audio processing and playback.

JavaScript: The application will be primarily built using JavaScript, the language of the web.

HTML and CSS: These technologies will be used for creating the user interface and styling it.

FileSaver.js: This library will be used for saving files directly to the user's computer.

Font Awesome: This library will be used for icons and other graphical elements.

Overall, the goal is to use a combination of modern web technologies to create a powerful and engaging music-making experience for users.
