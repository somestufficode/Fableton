Hello! This project, called "FableTon", is a web application built using the Tone.js library that allows users to create their own beats using a sequencer and a piano roll to play notes while the sequencer is playing. The sequencer has four different sound components, including a kick, hi-hat, snare, and an 808. Users can adjust the volume, tempo, and other parameters to customize their beats to their liking. The application also has a pause/play button.

The goal of the project is to provide a fun and engaging tool for music enthusiasts to create music in real-time! Users will be able to create custom beats using the sequencer, adjust the volume, tempo, and other parameters, save their created beats directly to their computer, and share their created beats with others via social media or direct URL.

In addition to the features mentioned above, the project will include clear and concise instructions on how to use the application in the README file. The interface will be easy-to-navigate, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Real-time audio processing and playback will be used for smooth and seamless beat creation. The design will be responsive and optimized for desktop devices.

To build this project, we will be using the Tone.js library, which is a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. Tone.js is built directly on top of the Web Audio Api. It offers powerful audio processing and sequencing capabilities, allowing us to create complex music applications with ease. Additionally, we will be using HTML and CSS for creating the user interface and styling it.

Overall, the goal is to use a combination of modern web technologies to create a powerful and engaging music-making experience for users with the FableTon application.

In the future, I aim to become proficient in managing the volume inputs and outputs of each node to avoid jumbled and complicated sounds during implementation and minor adjustments. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a sound graph that correlates with the beat to visualize an image.
